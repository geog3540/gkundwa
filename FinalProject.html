      <h1 class="my-4"> Final Project - Effects of Marijuana legalization on the homelessness crisis issue
        <small>GEOG 3540</small>
      </h1>
      <h2>Goals and Objectives</h2>

      <p>The goals of this project are to track if there is a significant effect of the legalization of marijuana and an increase in homeless people. There are numerous causes of homelessness, including lack of affordable housing, a history of racial inequality, mental illness, and addiction to drugs, including marijuana (Sleet & Francescutti, 2021). Marijuana has also been legalized in many states for both medical and recreational purposes. One of the main reasons to allow marijuana in many states was to reduce the number of people being convicted for the possession of marijuana, especially low-income people and marginalized communities (Hall, 2020). However, legalizing marijuana could have created more issues for marginalized communities, such as an increase in crimes when people are under the influence of drugs(Wu et al., 2021). There may also have been an increase in the cost of living in the areas where recreational marijuana was legalized, as many people would move to the area, pushing out low-income people onto the streets and contributing to homelessness.
         Homelessness is a topic that I care about as I am getting a master's degree in Urban and Regional Planning. I have learned that there have been programs to help people overcome homelessness, such as building shelters and implementing assisted housing programs. However, those efforts were not successful, and many people returned to the streets. I am interested in learning why there is an increase in homeless people and what can be done to reduce the homelessness in the United States. In this visualization, I will track the increase in homelessness in the United States from 2013 to 2023. Additionally, I will incorporate the aspect of legalization to see if there is any correlation.</p>

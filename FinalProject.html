      <h1 class="my-4"> Maps - Effects of Marijuana legalization on the homelessness crisis issue
        <small>GEOG 3540</small>
      </h1>
      <h2>Goals and Objectives</h2>

      <p>The goals of this project are to track if there is a significant effect of the legalization of marijuana and an increase in homeless people. There are numerous causes of homelessness, including lack of affordable housing, a history of racial inequality, mental illness, and addiction to drugs, including marijuana (Sleet & Francescutti, 2021). Marijuana has also been legalized in many states for both medical and recreational purposes. One of the main reasons to allow marijuana in many states was to reduce the number of people being convicted for the possession of marijuana, especially low-income people and marginalized communities (Hall, 2020). However, legalizing marijuana could have created more issues for marginalized communities, such as an increase in crimes when people are under the influence of drugs(Wu et al., 2021). There may also have been an increase in the cost of living in the areas where recreational marijuana was legalized, as many people would move to the area, pushing out low-income people onto the streets and contributing to homelessness.
         Homelessness is a topic that I care about as I am getting a master's degree in Urban and Regional Planning. I have learned that there have been programs to help people overcome homelessness, such as building shelters and implementing assisted housing programs. However, those efforts were not successful, and many people returned to the streets. I am interested in learning why there is an increase in homeless people and what can be done to reduce the homelessness in the United States. In this visualization, I will track the increase in homelessness in the United States from 2013 to 2023. Additionally, I will incorporate the aspect of legalization to see if there is any correlation.</p>
      
      <h2>Data Collection</h2>   

      <p>I will be using the data from US Department of Housing and Urban Development and US Census on the number of homeless in the US from 2013 to 2023. I will also be using academic papers on the effect of legalization of recreational marijuana on the increase of homelessness. There is also data on the times that states have legalized marijuana, both recreational and medical.
        However, there are limitation to the accuracy of data of homeless people. The numbers are people who were counted in shelters, transition housing, and outside on the streets. Since homeless people move from place to place and at different times. There might have been some individuals who were not counted. Also, the unsheltered homeless people are dispersed into cities which is not easy for a counting.
        The other limitation is that there are numerous causes of homelessness. Therefore, the legalization of marijuana cannot be single out to be the only determinant on the increase or decrease of homeless people.</p>

      <h2>Related Studies</h2>   
      <p>There have been studies on homelessness and drug use, especially recreational marijuana, as it has been legalized in many states and others are in the process. A study by James A. Sanderson at Clemson University found that "recreational cannabis legalization (RCL) adoption may also increase the prevalence of homelessness by perpetuating mental health issues related to cannabis use". Sanderson also concluded that the legalization of recreational marijuana attracts many people to the state, driving the cost of living higher. Additionally, in another study by Tyler et al., it was found that two-thirds of people experiencing homelessness have a history of addiction to marijuana and alcohol (Tyler et al., 2019). The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas conducted a study to determine the benefits and costs of legalizing recreational marijuana. The study found that there were economic benefits, such as an increase in the economy, but that came at the cost of an increase in crimes and homelessness. The study also included findings from other studies, such as an 8% increase in the number of homeless individuals in Colorado (Hesse, 2017). However, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas study discovered a 9% decrease in overall homelessness, implying that legalization reduces homelessness by 9 percent relative to the mean rate under no legalization. Nonetheless, the study also found a positive increase in street homelessness and chronic homelessness, which jumped by 35% in states with the legalization of recreational marijuana</p>
      
      <h2>Presentation Techniques</h2>
      <p>For this project I have created a choropleth map showing the legalization of recreational marijuana in the United States. 
        I have also created bivariate maps from 2013 to 2023 showing the correlation between percentage changes in chronic and overall homelessness. As mentioned, marijuana can lead to substance abuse one of the leading agents of chronic homelessness that can lead to increase in homelessness in general</p>

          <h2>Interpretation of flow Patterns </h2> 
        <p class="card-text"> 
          The flow map above illustrates the dynamic movement patterns of shared bikes within the city of Chicago, depicting their journeys from pickup to drop-off at various stations. This map utilizes flow lines to indicate the direction and volume of bike movement between stations, with nodes representing distinct bike stations categorized by NetFlow. To ensure optimal visibility against the gray background of the choropleth map, I chose a color scheme featuring black for the flow lines and red for the nodes. I also chose the Tear Drop flow line style was chosen to enhance the clarity and visual appeal of the presentation.</p>
        <p class="card-text"> 
          For spatial analysis, these flow map serve as valuable tools for analyzing the predominant destinations of bike riders within the city. On this flow map the spatial analysis reveals trend in bike flow patterns, with a predominant movement from north to south within Chicago. This directional preference aligns with the proximity of these routes to Lake Michigan and the downtown area, which boasts numerous tourist attractions. However, bike flows appear to diminish in the east-west direction of the city, as evidenced by the reduction in gross flow along these routes. For instance, station ID 13300 in the near lake Michigan exhibits a notably high gross flow, with a total of 5183 grows flow, comprising 2491 inflows and 2692 outflows. In contrast, stations with lower gross flows are in the west part of the city, as evidenced the station with Station ID TA1307000121 fewer total movements has only 995 gross-flows. </p>
        <p class="card-text"> 
          Overall, these flow maps provide valuable insights into the spatial dynamics of bike sharing within Chicago, shedding light on popular routes and destination preferences among riders. For the businesses renting the bikes, it can be used to ensure the bikes are put into places where most people will pick them. Also, such analyses can inform urban planning efforts and transportation infrastructure development aimed at enhancing the accessibility and efficiency of bike-sharing systems within the city.
